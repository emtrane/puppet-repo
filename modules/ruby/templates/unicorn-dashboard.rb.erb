# Sample verbose configuration file for Unicorn (not Rack)
#
# This configuration file documents many features of Unicorn
# that may not be needed for some applications. See
# http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/unicorn.conf.minimal.rb
# for a much simpler configuration file.
#
# See http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html for complete
# documentation.

# Use at least one worker per core if you're on a dedicated server,
# more will usually help for _short_ waits on databases/caches.
worker_processes 1

# Help ensure your application will always spawn in the symlinked
# "current" directory that Capistrano sets up.
working_directory "/var/www/dashboard/current" # available in 0.94.0+

# listen on both a Unix domain socket and a TCP port,
# we use a shorter backlog for quicker failover when busy
listen "/tmp/dashboard.sock", :backlog => 64
listen 3001, :tcp_nopush => true

# nuke workers after 30 seconds instead of 60 seconds (the default)
timeout 30

# feel free to point this anywhere accessible on the filesystem

# By default, the Unicorn logger will write to stderr.
# Additionally, ome applications/frameworks log to stderr or stdout,
# so prevent them from going to /dev/null when daemonized here:
stderr_path "/var/log/unicorn-dashboard.stderr.log"
stdout_path "/var/log/unicorn-dashboard.stdout.log"
